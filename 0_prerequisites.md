The following set ups are required to follow the practice sessions.

- Ubuntu linux (windows sub)system
- git (by default will be available in ubuntu)
- Python installed in your ubuntu
- Miniconda installed in your ubuntu


# Installing ubuntu

Ububtu linux subsystem in windows 10. [(install ubuntu)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview).


# Prepare the directory to be used in practice sessions

Once you have a working ubuntu environment, next thing I want you to have is a directory to put all the files created/read during the practice.

Pick either /mnt/c or /mnt/d or whatever division that has enough space.

Under there create __genomics_tutorial__ directory.

``mkdir genomics_tutorial``

From now on every data files used in this tutorial will be organized under that directory. First go into that directory.

``cd genomics_tutorial``

Under __genomics_tutorial/__ make __installation__ directory. There you'll put all the softwares installed during the practice.

``mkdir installation``


# Git (very much likely it's already there)
__git__ [(install git)](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-18-04/)


# Installing python

__python3.8__ [(install python 3.8)](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu) 


# Installing miniconda

__conda__ [(install conda)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) installed on your linux.
